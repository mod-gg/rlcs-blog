swiss stage
roster and org news is confusing but here we go
ssg drops retals and picks up lj (lotta drama about the retals drop)
faze replaces ayyjayy with mist
retals and ayyjayy team up and add majicbear as optic
furia join NA
crr leaves guild, moves to na, and joins complexity (replacing shad)
apparentlyjack and noly also do the eu -> na move, pick up chronic (1s main) and get picked up by GenG
dignitas moves to NA, grabs a bubble team (andy/delta/dreaz)
nrg/v1/g2 stay the same

a couple major upsets here: optic loses to pittsburgh knights, and dignitas beats nrg in 5!
