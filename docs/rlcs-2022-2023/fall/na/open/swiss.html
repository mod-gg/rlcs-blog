    <p>swiss stage</p>
    <h1>roster and org news is confusing but here we go</h1>
    <p>ssg drops retals and picks up lj (lotta drama about the retals drop)</p>
    <p>faze replaces ayyjayy with mist</p>
    <p>retals and ayyjayy team up and add majicbear as optic</p>
    <p>furia join NA</p>
    <p>crr leaves guild, moves to na, and joins complexity (replacing shad)</p>
    <p>apparentlyjack and noly also do the eu -> na move, pick up chronic (1s main) and get picked up by GenG</p>
    <p>dignitas moves to NA, grabs a bubble team (andy/delta/dreaz), luminosity and williams resolve join the party</p>
    <p>nrg/v1/g2 stay the same</p>
    <p>lol in the qualifier xset got smoked so bad they already dropped evoh for turinturo, we won't be seeing them today</p>
    <h1>r1 furia-complexity</h1>
    <p>complexity-furia, a classic na matchup, goes to furia's way in five</p>
    <p>a couple major upsets here: optic loses to pittsburgh knights, and dignitas beats nrg in 5!</p>

    <p>i can't wait to get to the point where i can prove this but i'm pretty sure v1 are the lowest boost team of any
    </p>
    <p>sol were an open qualifier team and they beat complexity, which is very confusing because complexity looked great
        against furia</p>
    <p>eu quals are happening at the same time and bds lost to EG and vitality lost to solary (kaydop/chausette/fairy)
        we'll have more about that later?</p>
    <p>memory lives! shopify win their first two matches of the day</p>

    <p>beastmode pushes faze, but faze ends up taking the win in OT</p>

    <h1>R3 g2-faze</h1>
    <p>faze demo'd all of g2 and then dribbled over their graves</p>

    <h1>R4 faze-optic</h1>
    <p>i don't think i like watching faze. syp might be the player i least enjoy of any top player</p>
    <p>optic got here by beating furia? sam teams struggling in na, i think that puts both of them in the 1-2 bracket</p>
