it's appjack's world and we're just living in it

# optic-ssg
rooting for optic here and they start strong

optic throws away game one at zero seconds, then game two starts with new kid lj leading the pack

two things can be true: ssg are winning this series because they're better, and also optic have played well enough to win outside of a few mistakes and bad shots
# shopify-faze
i didn't even know who was left on shopify, apparently they added paarth and 2piece, and i don't really know either of them but they beat faze in game one
first putting memory in the mix

syp putting this game on ice

or not! what a throw by faze, what a comeback by shopify!

that's a fucking ridiculous shot by syp. faze unfuck themselves and get their usual top 4 finish

# g2-furia
absolutely unfair that this has to be a quarterfinal, but that's new na i guess

 g2 in better shape overall, but furia scores bangers

caio's second own goal of the series might end the reverse sweep attempt

g2 take it in six, furia just made too many mistakes. if their mental recovers from this one, they're gonna translate into na no problem
