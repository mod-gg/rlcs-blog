# Semifinal: Optic - G2

optic had not yet beaten a major-level team _this year_ until faze, and they didn't look great against rebellion, so this is a very heavy g2 favorite. if optic can pull the upset they'll still need to win the grand final to make the major

g2 take the first two games by a goal apiece, but neither team looks great. optic's offensive timing is off, retals has often been arriving too late to convert plays so they've had to cycle possession i think more than they would want. on the other hand, g2 have really only scored on broken plays, so it's not like optic look entirely outclassed

optic clearly wanted better ball control coming out of the timeout, but majicbear has picked up a bad habit of giving the ball away in midfield, and g2 use that to clamp down on the boost and force optic into diving for the ball all over again. spoiler: that's not a great plan against g2

look at these sick passes from atomic. this is gonna be a sweep, without many highlights, becaue g2 just exploited absolutely everything optic did

optic look to have gotten the benefit of a joke bracket and a lucky match against faze, because they got absolutely clobbered. dignitas becomes the first team to jump from twelfth place to the major split-to-split, the previous largest jumps had been eighth and ninth from v1 and queso. they'll be the weakest major region team by a mile, but hey, good for them to make it

# Semifinal: Complexity - Faze

this is the battle of two incredible defenses. complexity have been best in the split defensively, while faze just shut out gen.g for three-and-a-half games. whoever wins this will have a shot at the one seed for the major, so there are still some stakes here

complexity come out hog wild, firing five shots in the first minute, and they eventually get rewarded by a wicked cheeky placement from el toro

analysts are yet to figure out where sypical came from to make this save, and i can't blame them

complexity definitely outplaying faze, but faze go up 2-0 with insane defense and poor shooting from the spanish speakers

this is a series for saves

another sweep, and we'll get a classic final 

# Final: G2 - Faze

faze would take the top seed for the region at the major with a win here, g2 have played mostly bad teams to get here so faze are favored for sure

atomic found space

faze have been able to reliably open space while having boost, and they're making g2 pay when they do

g2 with a second straight zero second equalizer, really came against the run of play

sypical gives g2 the hesi, and faze are well up now

g2 score a weird one, and first says nah, let's forget that ever happened

i love this flick and shot from g2

so faze take it in five, and it's not like g2 fell apart. faze just had more to give at every step. if they've truly been able to level up by bonding and trusting each other, they might be favored in the major
