# Group: Furia - Spacestation

two teams that can't seem to get over the hump, though ssg has performed a tier above furia so far since furia's move north. lj just broke the record for highest mmr in duos history, stealing it from monkey moon, will that show in his threes gameplay?

it's a sloppy start to the series and lostt evens it up at a game a piece with a herky jerky solo play

we're going to game five, will furia melt down again?

lj pops, and furia collapses

optic 3-1 over faze? didn't even need champions field? what got into optic today

# Group: Complexity - NRG

nrg just got lost to v1 after going 2-1 up, complexity just swept uh someone bad, this should be a pretty easy one

so, nrg are gonna do it?

rise was on rizzo's podcast recently and said that squishy should probably hang up the sticks, and that might be an overreaction but he looks slow and boring, not a great series from him and nrg in general to fall victim to their second reverse sweep of the split

dignitas lose to rebellion, furia beat g2, and optic sweeps m80, maybe it's optic's day after all

# Group: G2 - Spacestation

wild that this group also has furia in it. g2 would normally be favorites, but transitively their loss to furia puts them behind ssg.

what a gorgeous reverse angle snap shot from chicago

g2 double commit and ssg can't catch a break, atomic nails the finish

furia and ghost go to game five, if furia win they top the group, if they lose they're out. ghost go up 2-1...

knights, koi, & axle out, optic get a shocking bye

# Bracket: Version1 - M80

loser goes home, unreal that they're on such even footing given the expectations. the v1 not-move of rise for comm just seems to have torn them to shreds

that's an insane waterfall read. also an insane save attempt by beastmode, no idea how he got anything on this

v1 eliminate m80 from both today and the major, though m80 made themselves seem real contenders moving forward. elsewhere nrg got smacked by faze, rebellion beat ghost to be the saturday weak link, while ssg melt down on kickoff against dignitas, recover, and then blow it all over again to miss the major

the bracket sets up very well for g2, with v1/optic/rebellion as their compatriots on their side. dignitas are still favorite for the major because of how far up they are on everone else, but there's still a chance...
