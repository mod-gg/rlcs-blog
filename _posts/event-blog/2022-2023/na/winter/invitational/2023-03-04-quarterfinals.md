# Quarterfinal: Version1 - G2

v1 need to make at least the grand finals to go to the major, and while they're on the easier side of the bracket g2 have v1's number in recent showdowns

you can tell the influence gen.g has on na right now, as comm/beastmode/atomic are all using chronic's preferred decal/boost combo

beastmode starts this series with a sick passing play

ah, the open net miss followed by the impossible pre-jump save. comm, folks

is this the touch that breaks up version1?

g2 hasn't looked great defensively but haven't been punished for poor spacing until now

i swear sometimes he's playing a whole different game

what!!! even torment is surprised by this one

g2 had the ball all but a pixel over the line, then comm made another save off the inside of his own crossbar, but eventually v1's mistakes catch up to them as beastmode double commits underneath an air dribbling comm and g2 knocks it into an open net to take the swing game

four consecutive clean touches for g2 spells absolute disaster for v1

we've made it to champions field, and comm likes it here

ATOMIC OFF THE TOP ROPE

that was a pretty sick series. it looked like v1 were dead in the water but pulled themselves up and even had the lead on champions field. v1 won't go to the major, and are expected to make the roster move they couldn't complete last window

# Quarterfinal: Optic - Rebellion

the weakest quarterfinal on expectations alone, each can only make the major if they win the whole tournament. fan vote goes **93%** in favor of optic, that's about as strong as i've seen

we're six minutes in and rebellion are up 5-1 on aggregate. memory has a flip reset bump goal and now a self-pass in the corner. optic? bueller?

2piece just took majicbear's lunch

ayyjayy misses a freebie and comes back with this zero-angle winner, what an inconsistent player he's become
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=GoodLovelyLemurMau5-Q6ADidPKqIFHyPDQ&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

2piece undresses optic, and it's all square in the swing game
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=RoundLivelyJaguarNotATK-fNCRYRx-V_rdAXzX&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

majicbear has made 10 top 8s and had never made a top 4, but that streak has been snapped. gotta imagine optic gets smushed by g2, but it's nice to see them make a real push for the first time in a while

# Quarterfinal: Complexity - Dignitas

if dignitas can win this they clinch the major. they're _probably_ going to make it anyway, assuming optic don't win it all, but i'm sure they'd feel good about clinching on their own

complexity are outplaying dig, but at least andy puts in a beaut
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ThirstyTenaciousTurnipSeemsGood-mRtFOeouF2deMo2-&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

there have been infinite post hits in this game, and complexity make a houdini escape on this one
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=RacyVibrantPonyHassaanChop-e3mjbNCRcZYQ-XWp&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

complexity on the verge of a sweep, but dig can still hit some clips
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ThankfulSweetGoshawkDancingBanana-16iEYmpig54Zp6xU&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

vamos
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BoredPrettyPartridgeYee-LWMcZXfFlJrbl5e8&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

complexity get the sweep. dig now need optic to lost to clinch, which _probably_ will happen against g2 tomorrow, but you never know

# Quarterfinal: Gen.G - Faze

potential battle for the na one seed in this rematch of last grand final

chronic is getting space and he is _punishing_ faze. no backboard defense, no problem
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=OpenBoringTrayChefFrank-lL4OovxThNyy51IN&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

apparentlyjack makes the save and hits on the counter, and gen.g might be rolling now
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=PleasantNimbleWasabiFutureMan-V0NH50-bvtmbORh6&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

faze grind gen.g into dust. gen.g can't score for the last three-and-a-half games, even with this last minute onslaught, and they'll finish outside the top two for the first time as a roster
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=CooperativeToughGoblinGOWSkull-IHeo5WB9WW8EN5Kt&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

so we'll have a semifinals of g2-optic and complexity-faze, should be kinda weird out here
