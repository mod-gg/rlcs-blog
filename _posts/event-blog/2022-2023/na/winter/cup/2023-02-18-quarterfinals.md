# G2 - Spacestation

g2 crushed the groups, ssg have been less convincing, but ssg still have a reasonable shot here

when g2 are humming they're so quick, and it looked like game two would be as much of a demolition as game one, but daniel keeps it in range

impeccable use of space

that is an unfair way to get a reset, how would you ever see that coming as a defender

arsenal and lj have run into each other _a lot_, and arsenal keeps swiping boost from daniel. i don't really see how this iteration of ssg stays together long term anyway, the timelines and aspirations don't match up, and this makes it seem like they're not even comming with each other

if you want something done right you've gotta do it yourself jknaps

ssg come down to their last life and survive

g2 scored first in all seven games, but ssg have practiced the comebacks at this point

# Faze - Knights

winner jumps into a major slot, at least for now. seems like it should be clear who the winner is, but m80 took out faze last regional so maybe they're just more vulnerable now?

firstkiller: still good

faze don't respect knights. in a tie game first goes for a pogo, syp goes demo chasing, and they don't get burnt at all. the only highlights from here might be freestyles

casual double reset pass

# Complexity - Koi

i have no idea how koi made it this far. they lost 12 matches in a row before their current 2 match winning streak, and i can't imagine that winning streak continues against an in-form complexity

gyro has other ideas though, this is sick to watch from each camera angle

and gyro again! it seems like he clicks less often these days, but this was a throwback performance for him

crr was up _so_ early for this. it feels like series over, and it's only 1-1

koi are just playing full send. they get a lot of reward, but they also get burnt

this clip starts and ends with great corner plays by reysbull. i thought the first one was nicer, but the second was more effective

Need boost!

# M80 - Gen.G

the bubble scene in NA is real, m80 earning back-to-back top eight placements, but last time they got smoked by complexity and this time they're probably getting smoked by gen.g

gen.g win three clinical games with no highlights. just clean rocket league
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AssiduousDifficultHyenaBudStar-CTgZPDH3M4zggPpk&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

then as soon as m80 look like they might actually take a game, chronic shows up

this series was over. kaput. donezo. then m80 steal game four in overtime, blow out gen.g by five in game five, and utterly dominate game six overtime until they miss an open net, and it all falls apart
