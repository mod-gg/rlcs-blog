dig beat optic in five with a zero second winner from dreaz. v1 need a reverse sweep against knights, but they do convert it. koi sets a record for most series lost in a row (rip to the time i thought gyro was a top player, and where the heck has aqua's theoretical ascendancy gone). faze perfect sweep rebellion. m80 *_sweep_* nrg

# Group: Optic - Gen.G

optic are looking about as bad as they could conceive of, while gen.g are the best team in the region. i don't know how optic could win this one, and that's even with gen.g being not as great on fridays

the path to optic winning is ayyjayy popping off

elsewhere, nrg lost game one to rebellion 5-1, and uh that's pretty bad, given that rebellion were just perfect swept themselves

left, right

maybe it's ayyjayy's day? he has all four of their goals in this series

gen.g escape ayyjayy in four games, retals and majicbear both looked rough. nrg recovered to beat rebellion in four, and the only other notable result is ssg sweeping furia to put them 0-2 and going into a must-win against akrew. other knockouts are optic-koi, knights-ghost, and m80-rebellion

# Group: NRG - Faze

i don't know how nrg wins this matchup. faze by a million

a rare bump play from nrg kicks it off in their favor!

nrg takes a game, but faze starts the next with a lovely short passing play

i love an overhead passing play like this

it looked okay for nrg, but faze was too much in the end

a round of sweeps from the rest of the winners' sides: complexity over ssg, g2 over v1, gen.g over dignitas. optic/shopify/ghost/akrew go out. optic break koi's losing streak! can't imagine it gets much lower than this for retals & ayyjayy

# Bracket: NRG - Spacestation

ssg just got donkey stomped by complexity, so i think nrg will feel like they have a good shot on this one compared to the other higher level teams

garrett nails one over the shoulder, and nrg are looking good?

ssg are basically dead, but arsenal recovers from missing the first pass to slot home the return cross

so much for ssg dying. nrg's touch completely deserts them for the last two games, and ssg survives one last flourish to get themselves into their normal top 8

lolll koi go from longest losing streak in na history to knocking off optic and v1 back to back, with a reverse sweep on v1 to boot. they're getting some of the vamos power on their side

m80 _sweep_ furia. knights beat dignitas, which will really mess with the race for 5th.
