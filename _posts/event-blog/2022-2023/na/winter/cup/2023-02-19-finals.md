# Semifinal: G2 - Faze Clan

we're getting to `major` territory: g2 clinch for both themselves and complexity with a win, faze have more ground to make up since they went out so early in the open

a series between two teams who both expect to be here? how unusual. can't wait to see how fourth clan return to their reign of losing in the semis

game two was eleven scoreless minutes, game three starts with mist chucking his car forward and getting it to work

# Semifinal: Complexity - Gen.G

it's a rematch of last regional final, and complexity still hold the overall advantage, but gen.g are a different team on sundays

gen.g try to get fancy, complexity laser the ball into the bottom corner

i still can't quite figure out what exactly gen.g are doing. they keep saying they're "thinking the game" unlike any other team, and that it's their teamwork, but i don't exactly see how that reflects still. maybe clutch is real? the commentators keep saying that their weakness is the demo game, because that's what m80 won a couple games with, but i think the real key to that was that m80 felt like they could win the 1-1 matchups and spread themselves accordingly, which gave them the license to demo. m80 for two games managed to isolate gen.g in a way that made gen.g weaker, which is very hard to do, and no one seems to be able to do reliably, i think that's what lionblaze used to do against peak nrg too, which is why he was constantly a thorn in their side (i wanna look into upset pct by player at some point because it seems like lion has pulled a lot of them without ever being on a top tier team).

# Final: Gen.G - Faze

early on in the season it was faze as the thorn in gen.g's side, and then gen.g wiped the floor with faze in a regional final and it hasn't been the same since. faze won early in part by [drawing gen.g out and forcing gen.g to take the initiative](https://mod-gg.github.io/rlcs-blog/2022/10/20/analyze-geng.html), but faze has supposedly shifted their playstyle around again so we'll see if they can regain that level of effectiveness. both teams are undefeated on the weekend, where there hasn't been an undefeated winner yet this season over a whole weekend. no matter what, we'll still have only two na teams on the season with event wins, just the distribution will go one way or the other

MIST FROM THE TOP ROPE

gen.g called a timeout after game 1? never seen that one before, something must have caught them really off guard

faze win even after the timeout. gen.g start game three strong, but yet another wicked faze double tap puts sypical in the spotlight

hot dang faze clan pulled it out at the end. scored three in a minute, and they'll take their second regional of the year. coach roll dizz will be psyched. sypical gotta be mvp, he scored ~everything for them. gen.g _can_ lose, and once again i'll wonder about how faze's best-case playstyle specifically counters gen.g.
