# G2 - Gen.G

will gen.g continue their finals streak, or will g2 reassert dominance? unfortunately it'll be subie telling us about it, but at least we get jorby

jack gives one away and then earns it back in nifty fashion

chronic completely freezes the g2 back line with a great hesitation on the reset

gen.g with a dominant win. after the first minute of the series, gen.g won like 15-1 or something crazy. it wasn't close

# Complexity - Dignitas

dig started the series much stronger, but halfway through game two reysbull wakes up

this is one of my favorite types of goals

complexity were better. dig still have a shot at the major. both sides played hard

# Complexity - Gen.G

complexity are 3-0 against gen.g so far this year, the only team able to consistently take them down. all of those are in the group stage, and the game score is 9-1 in aggregate so far. gen.g probably still the favorite due to their overall results, but this is the first time in a while that the matchup isn't in their favor

gen.g start strong

long clip to show complexity's dominance in possession and how they can really clamp down

on the other hand, gen.g can score incredible goals like nothing

how does reysbull golf this one out of the corner

complexity aren't out of this yet

gen.g are up 2-1 in the series, but call a timeout anyway because they got brazilled by complexity and it wasn't even that close.

complexity storm out to an early game 4 lead with crr especially peaking, but gen.g bring it back in a long overtime and then start match point with yet another pre-jump. complexity fully on the ropes now

another one for gen.g

that's the last team that had the mental edge over gen.g, and while complexity were able to push for about two and a half games, gen.g snapped back into form and rode it out. five grand finals, three victories. jack has been saying that gen.g are the only team in the world that think at their level, and it shows: they're 24-3 in game score over their last two playoff brackets and they have more than double as many points as any team outside of faze (who are still 40% back). hopefully this is the dawn of complexity peaking - all three of crr/reysbull/ajg looked like top ten players in the world for flashes, they have the chops for sure. faze and v1 the biggest disappointments here, both need multiple good results to make the major now
