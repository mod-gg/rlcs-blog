# NRG - G2
the 63rd matchup between these teams in rlcs sees g2 as a heavy favorite, but you always throw out the records in these old rivalry matches

this is how you whittle a team down to nothing

g2 with the comeback, squishy looks crushed

nrg choke away a completely open net among a number of chances, g2 puts the series on match point, and what looked like a tight one is likely gonna end before the distance

g2 takes it in 5. nrg hasn't beaten g2 in a real match in nearly a calendar year, which is nuts for teams that play this often

# Furia - Gen.G

gen.g took the highest percentage of available points in a single split in fall: 90% including winning the major. furia brought in lostt and went 3-0 in groups

noly does em dirty and appjack poolshots in the finish

# Spacestation - Dignitas

dignitas do have a little hype behind them, dreaz/evoh are both post-hype prospects who no longer have the pressure on them to be insane, but ssg are a major-quality team in a way dignitas likely are not

it's daniel's world and dignitas are just living in it

sick own goal

that is a looong OT

dig took the timeout! they're the ones on match point and they needed a cooldown so bad they took the TO

insane double tap pass from daniel

dig take it! ssg in a tough situation where a win was the only option, and they blew it. dig with a weird tourney â€” they're top four with two losses and three wins, two of which were over ssg & v1

# Complexity - M80

okay if dignitas was an upset, M80 (lionblaze/kinseh/percy) would be a shock. former xset were the bottom seed. lost first two games and only squeaked by optic, then became the worst team to ever beat faze. complexity are now in a more extreme position than ssg just were: heavy favorites for a final, a loss here _or_ in the semis would be extremely disappointing given this bracket (and that complexity are bootcamped). the crr transfer from summer ought to be paying off right about now, so hopefully their 3-0 group was a precursur for good form

i love these passes

complexity took care of business in a way ssg could not, and crr caps it beautifully
