i can't wait to get to the point where i can prove this but i'm pretty sure v1 are the lowest boost team of any

sol were an open qualifier team and they beat complexity, which is very confusing because complexity looked great
against furia
eu quals are happening at the same time and bds lost to EG and vitality lost to solary (kaydop/chausette/fairy)
we'll have more about that later?
memory lives! shopify win their first two matches of the day
syp rips

beastmode pushes faze, but faze ends up taking the win in OT

# R4 faze-optic
i don't think i like watching faze. syp might be the player i least enjoy of any top player
optic got here by beating furia? sam teams struggling in na, i think that puts both of them in the 1-2 bracket
nice to see ayyjayy back in a normal situation

# R5 nrg-furia
i just want to watch furia win and nrg lose. turns out i'm anti-nrg in addition to being anti-faze

optic knock out complexity in game five, and i am sad about it
nrg are rolling back the clock against furia, but furia get the knockout

na is gonna be very interesting, there are about 12 teams that feel top-8 quality. complexity and nrg not making it, rebellion going through on the 3-1 round, just an overall hard region in a new way which is pretty exciting
