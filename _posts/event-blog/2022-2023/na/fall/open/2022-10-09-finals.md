# ssg-geng
geng with a hot start, looking faster and less mistake-prone than ssg (except for one appjack mess, which led to ssg's only goal)
can't let jack get in a 1-1

ssg took a timeout and earned their way back into the series, but geng wasn't having it, they followed this up with a kickoff goal to go up 3-1

geng will make the grand finals in their first tourney after walking ssg. ssg came into this series 22-3 in game score, and they'll leave losing more games in this series than they had since season start. lj no goals or assists, arsenal few demos and touches, overall whitewash by the euros and chronic
# g2-faze
we got the answer to "is mist a bad pickup" already by faze making it here, but now we get to answer "is he a differentiator" and faze come out rolling

g2 look like they'll at least force a gentleman's sweep, but good lord look at this save in the first moment from mist

# faze-geng
i don't think either were favorites to get to this point, but they both waxed their semifinal opponents, should be fun, probably leaning toward faze for prediction but rooting for geng

boring start to the series, as faze is <i>just better</i> for the first three-and-a-half games, even if geng steals one in the middle

faze win the first tournament of the season for the second season in a row. last time it felt like that would just be how the whole season went. this time, there's much more skepticism. still, great win for them. probably gonna test out a blog about what changed for geng against faze compared to all their other games
