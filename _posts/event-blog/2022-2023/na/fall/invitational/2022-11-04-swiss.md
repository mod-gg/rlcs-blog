# Roster/Quals News

- this is only top 16 in points, no quals for this round. there were a couple tiebreakers between no-names to get here, looks like sol and 26rising were the ones to make it through. no turbopolsa, that's on deck for a roster move
- gen.g, v1, faze are ~locks, ssg are basically locked in for the rotterdam major as long as they make saturday
- it's basically a six team race for the last spot: g2, nrg, optic, furia, complexity, shopify are all within a great placement of getting in
- any tiebreakers remaining happen after the grand finals on sunday, hope we get one

# R1: Complexity - Optic
apparently optic aren't feeling great? also crr is in the dominus!

complexity really know how to send the house

gorgeous redirect, and complexity are off to the races

the dominus just _looks_ better

optic looked like they were locked in to force champions field, but more in doubt after the massive fake from crr

game five starts with a banger

optic's first highlight goal of the series cements the reverse sweep

corruptedg is playing in place of taroco for rogue â€” they took a game off ssg, though no more than that

# R2: G2 - NRG
nrg makes a big game one comeback, but chicago puts it away immediately in the surprising OT
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AntediluvianHappyTroutAllenHuhu-e9jc8wsjx56aEBaW&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

not even surprising to see atomic nail this

g2 earn three goals, only put one on the scoresheet
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AthleticSparklyAirGuitarCeilingCat-V1MxqgD60sp8BS7g&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

on the right side is complexity melting, on the left is a gorgeous optic goal
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AbstemiousAffluentQuailBloodTrail-tGpoLeQC3IMp2ANb&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

faze don't let optic through that easily (faze win in OT on an optic team bump)
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=RoughDoubtfulMomLitFam-7zqbhTUm5P1EF5j-&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

the 2-0 teams make sense: g2, gen.g, faze, ssg. complexity in the 0-2 hole is pretty rough

# R3: Furia - V1
this would be for v2 to clinch a major spot, which felt like a formality before they lost to 26rising in round one

comm beats the furia rotation, gets space, and cleans up game one

take your time and pick your spot yan

that's perfection
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=CarelessBoredSaladMVGame-JCTx81fVw_9yw7rf&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

furia win in 5 on a v1 double commit team bump freebie, no good for v1

optic have gone down 0-2 in all three series they've played: successful reverse sweeps against complexity and pk and only the highlights above from faze kept them from a trio

we were a few pixels from a zero second corruptedg assist to force game five overtime, but dignitas got in the way

# R4: NRG - Faze
this has to be faze. faze have beaten basically all of swiss for the whole split except for their last hiccup against ssg. i can't root for anyone here

or not?
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=HyperTallStorkAliens-yU8lIrUSjsxuXZUy&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

nrg actually held most of the pressure, then faze happened

this isn't even basic freeplay, this is drew it up in a fever dream level freeplay
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SpineyHelplessBarracudaHassaanChop-J0kDv8up_Opxf1t5&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

that'll end the series, what height first gets on the last touch of this air dribble

complexity survive to round five

# R5: Complexity - Furia
:sad:

great balance by caio to isolate the defender
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=CuteManlyDuckMrDestructoid-ePGWL3UvpXKVJT4Y&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

furia are muuuuuuch better than complexity, outshooting them 18-1 in game two even if it was a one goal game til the final second

complexity storm back! with effective, standard sam play, and a wicked save at the last second, they kick furia from the major
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AdorableGleamingPartridgeTF2John-ZVBE8HUDb-Oi9gu7&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

nrg lose to pk to miss out on the major, as do optic when they lose to v1
