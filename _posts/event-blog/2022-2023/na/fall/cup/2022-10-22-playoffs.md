# Optic - NRG
this feels like the weakest quarterfinal, though it would be kinda fun to find out that sizz was the problem and all nrg needed was a new coach

this series is a real throwback. lotta corner play, very defensive posturing, kinda like when the peeps won dreamhack with demos and everyone tried to copy them but didn't really know how yet, but we still get glimpses of ayyjayy

what if you made the whole plane out of ayyjayy

# Furia - V1
v1 races to an early lead on beastmode's bumper, and i swear this is a wicked hard read that stax and daz just gloss over. he jumps so early and has to track it over his own head!

three goals in the first minute, no goals for two minutes, four goals in the next minute. when it rains it pours, and caard puts on an exclamation point

it's almost fun to get to see the absolute chaos on the v1 backline before the final punishment comes through
