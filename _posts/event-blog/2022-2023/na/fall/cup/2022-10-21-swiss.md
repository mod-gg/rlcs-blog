# Roster/Quals News

- xset still don't make top 16, they might be on the eunited track at this point
- nrg make a coach change! epicjonny in for sizz
- other teams not making it even to swiss: luminosity (lionblaze), darkzero (turbo), PK (zps), in their place will be some new people i've never heard of

# R1 NRG — Furia
we get a rematch of swiss round five from the open, where furia beat nrg in five to move to the weekend. we also get leif actually casting instead of hosting? been a minute...

# R2 V1 — G2
comm is getting 2.5 demos/game, but v1 are winning less than half their matches so far...

v1 starts strong, g2 puts a nice play together to equalize

# R3 G2 - Furia
g2 absolutely crushed v1, can they do the same for furia? or can furia and complexity place the top two na seeds under sam ownership?

furia get the lead, yan gets the read

g2 scored like five straight over the back half of game one into game two, but furia found some teeth

caard doesn't let it get away this time, and the series is fair and square

furia and faze take top seeds, they get to play the (relative) weaklings tomorrow, probably like ssg/complexity/g2? it's _hard_ out here
sidebar: nrg swept gen.g? lief said the eu boys were giving nrg too much respect...

# R4 G2 - SSG
this was shaping up to be a tightly contested series with no highlights, then daniel showed up

immediately followed by a bonkers bump

this is just the series for unconventional flips

ssg manage to fend off the reverse sweep, juuuust barely

multiple reverse sweeps in this stage (optic over 26rising, gen.g over axle, complexity > v1), and now g2 will be playing probably furia in the quarters (assuming they win)

also the third regional, the invitational, is only for the top 16 teams in points, so there'll be a 3-way playoff during the week for the final slot which'll be fun

# R5 G2 - Gen.G
one the one hand, ridiculous that one of these teams won't make it to saturday. on the other, there's no one who will have made top eight who won't have deserved it...

v1 & optic are the other two to come through from the final round. g2 gets reverse-swissed, winning their first two then losing out. faze, furia, ssg, complexity, nrg, gen.g, v1, optic are your quarterfinalists. probably the only surprise is nrg instead of g2? but i think that was just strength of schedule differences playing out — nrg got wins against gen.g, dignitas, rogue (and lost to furia) while g2 went v1-furia-ssg-gen.g after their friendly round one win. i'd bet if g2 had drawn dignitas they woulda made it through, but, sometimes it just don't work for ya
