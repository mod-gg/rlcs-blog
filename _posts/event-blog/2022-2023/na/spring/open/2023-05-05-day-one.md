# Roster/Quals News
- there is one transfer that matters and one transfer only: in the wake of torment retiring, v1 add daniel to beastmode (and comm, i guess)
- ssg replace daniel with hockser. they were never gonna be able to pull off a true replacement, but this likely knocks them to borderline top eight
- koi are now gyro/cheese/sosa, a combo of rogue and pk knights
- a shock coaching move, as nick leaves shock major participants dignitas, replaced by violentpanda?
- some org changes on the bubble too: pittsburgh knights no longer exist
- split format is double elimination upper/lower brackets

# Upper Bracket: Furia - Gen.G

noly starts the split with a nice redirect

furia, forever tantalizing

g2 reverse swept by sup, who i think is money/xpurt/ayjacks? that's not a good team, and this isn't the type of tournament to throw away a game on day one. nrg beat dignitas, but pretty stock across the board otherwise

# Upper Quarterfinals: NRG - Gen.G

hey, let's find out if nrg have it this spl...oops there's two gen.g goals. this series might be already over

yep, that's a sweep and it's not close. elsewhere, chalk again, except ssg with hockser reverse sweep faze! each round producing one upset so far, let's see if lowers can do the same

# Lower Round One: Furia - Dignitas

already an elim match for these two, both will be disappointed

lostt can really style sometimes, what an angle

yan too

dig go out at the first opportunity, and that's likely to have worlds/major implications later

elsewhere shopify hang a ten spot against a team i haven't heard of, g2 & koi trade 6 goal games before g2 settles and takes the win

# Lower Round Two: G2 - Faze

faze will expect to win this, but it's dangerous to be down here at all and there's no doubt that g2 have the potential for the upset

jknaps with the mental 1v3, and g2 take the early advantage

when g2 look good they look _really_ good

atomic is on right now

g2 win in a sweep! atomic carries the boys to victory, and faze lose six straight games across two series to go out in day one

v1 join faze, also losing six straight games across complexity & furia. beastmode and daniel won't make this weekend, somehow

sup, rebellion are the other surprise top 8 teams, knocking out m80 and nrg respectively. optic also top 8 due to a friendly upper bracket run over koi and sup
