the whole bracket is happening in one day, so whoever wins is going to have won three best-of-sevens, which is a loooooong day

# Liquid - Gen.G

eu #2 vs na #1, chronic vs acronik, eu vs former eu. gen.g have struggled in swiss and come around in playoffs before, can they do it again

##### 0-0

acronik sets it off with a great pass

gen.g stabilized but only had a chance or two, it's gonna be tricky

##### 1-0

atow with a 1v3 against some soft gen.g defense

jack jumps the shark on the dish attempt and gets burnt

appjack keeps getting shots and acronik keeps saving them. four saves on jack alone in this match. timeout gen.g

##### 2-0

uh oh time for gen.g

gen.g chooses the `punch them in the mouth` strat, then chronic goes dancing

##### 2-1

chronic taking this touch backward actually makes space for the pass and shot. no idea if it was intentional, but it beat the defense by a lot

liquid start reading ~every gen.g attack, break out on the counter a bunch into open space, and take the victory anyway.

##### 3-1

ugly goals left and right as it's 2-2 within a minute and no one is happy about it

every touch is bad now, 4-3 gen.g, eat at arby's

##### 3-2

gen.g hit the pass play again

that's about as good an open netter as you'll see

##### 3-3

we've got a game seven, seems pretty deserved. i don't think gen.g have peaked in this series, but they've ground out enough to be in with a shot

absolute filth from apparentlyjack and he knows it
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AliveHedonisticClintmullinsDoubleRainbow-YBIQsVzvV-jE8hnU&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

that's all it took. gen.g took the wind out of liquid and didn't trail after game five. blocked 'em, bumped 'em, hassled 'em on every touch. liquid just couldn't create advantageous field dynamics 

# Version1 - Secret

this is the matchup where i have the least expectation that the winner will advance past the next round. could beastmode pop off? could secret win smash-and-grabs with defense and surprises? sure, i guess, but i think this series is the pinnacle for both of them

##### 0-0

secret start out with 90 seconds of pure pressure, forcing v1 into 5 saves but never breaking through, even with the ball 80% over the line at one point

let's gooo

##### 0-1

it's a slog of a series, but secret break through twice in short order, and now v1 have to take the timeout

##### 0-2

comm on the receiving end of some trash for this one

a ridiculous layoff

v1 score three of the four goals in regulation, and there are two good shots each way on zero seconds, but we go to overtime at 2-2

maaaaan v1 were starving secret for basically seven straight minutes
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ProductiveWonderfulAnacondaWOOP-yAnzUV5kuTJrFBsH&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

fourth longest rlcs lan overtime as torment sets the lan game record

##### 1-2

i dunno man, secret just keep winning 1-0 games. this time v1 create two great last second chances - once beastmode is still grabbing boost, the other a beastmode air dribble gets spiked down near the goal line on zero seconds. secret to match point, and this game _promises_ to be a grind

##### 1-3

kv1 has a disconnect right at the start of the game, so we get a functional second timeout

survive and advance!

# Oxygen - Faze

the crowd is _here_ for the dutch. oxygen have been about as good as a team can be in swiss so far, crushing everything in sight in their three wins, and will look to prevent faze from hitting their perpetual top 4. you'd think this would be a clip heavy series too, let's hope these teams are well warmed up

##### 0-0

firstkiller whiffs a side wall bounce, archie puts in an open net. sypical whiffs side wall bounce, joreuz puts in an open net. roll dizz is gonna have an easy coaching job after this one

##### 1-0

kickoff goal for archie. kickoff goal for archie. faze are down two goals in eighteen seconds, they look baffled out here

it takes a whole 23 seconds for oxygen to find a third, and they get to complete a _wide open_ midfield pass for what becomes basically a penalty kick

a well earned and fun goal

##### 2-0

faze can't find the goal with a map until a deflection and an open net with under 30 seconds left give them their first lead of the series. faze have to batten down the hatches, but they do get a win

##### 2-1

blink and you miss a four goal lead
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=CalmAmazingPangolinWOOP-J-xJOE-JsTDBoGZk&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

maybe oxygen only had two good games in them, cause they look discombobulated

##### 2-2

oxygen go up 3-0 just as easy as faze did, though not quite as quickly. boring wins are good wins

##### 3-2

oxygen couldn't combine pressure and boost control well, and faze force seven

##### 3-3

that's _rude_
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=FunSmilingGerbilWoofer-hlvGsaP429tDfTTU&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

mist won this game

oxygen beat g2, gen.g, and version1, but go home in the quarterfinals playing yet another na team (i have a hunch they would've beaten ssg too). faze still on their way to their usual top 4, though it's been unsteady to get here

# Karmine Corp - Moist

> LET'S GET WET! LET'S GET WET! LET'S GET WET!

##### 0-0

aztral pops for the first minute, but an air dribble bump opens the scoring the other way

yeah, aztral is popping

only kc's second _game_ loss of the tournament

##### 0-1

moist score early and ride it out with dominant possession and physical play. never felt like kc were in it at all. moist taking two games at all felt like a stretch, being up 2-0 is wild

##### 0-2

aztral with the shush
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SullenExuberantShingleBabyRage-beHx7BZEUkkqUr7t&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

kc win despite _that_ with a brace from vatira, we're in a series for sure

##### 1-2

aztral keeps scoring
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BusyNimbleQueleaSuperVinlin-f73s11zBFV6tmaFu&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

vati nails it

moist close the game out, and it's aztral ruining karmine corp on both ends. not really sure what kc can do from here

##### 1-3

joyo with the reset pass, and kc are out!
