# 2-1: Version1 - PWR

can OCE get their first top 8 since rlcsx? probably not! but maybeeeeee

##### 0-0

torsos _has_ to put that shot to either side, but instead he drills it down the middle and v1's counter ends in a wicked beastmode angle

##### 1-0

torsos has had some great mechs, but he whiffs a long save and that's two big mistakes so far this series

not great for pwr

v1 perfect sweep pwr to earn a middle seed for sunday. ggwp pretty easy

# 2-1: Moist - Secret

not really sure how secret made it here, they'll have to figure out a way to throw a wrench into moist in a new way. also rise speaks portuguese, so if he pops off you can bet secret are gonna hear about it

##### 0-0

nxghtt has gotten about 3 1v1s and managed to score one of them. that was enough, because secret outpaced moist and held them to three shots. wild

##### 0-1

what a pass from aztral

kv1 can't quite get the right clear, and joyo slots it. even series now

##### 1-1

perfect challenge by nxghtt, he's their best player

nxghtt follows that up by saving a 1v2 waterfall with a pre-jump. flow state

this is a clinical defensive stand, and sad with the dagger

##### 1-2

3:18 of defending, 0:01 for the pinch challenge

nxghtt sets up everything

quadrant down. ssg down. moist down. secret through. what a run, what a series of upsets. 

# 2-1: Gen.G - Faze Clan

one of the top two na seeds will go through, the other will be unexpectedly in the final round of swiss. faze was winning this matchup early, but gen.g took their last matchup and even the game record between the two. this _should_ be a sick matchup

##### 0-0

chronic looking good early

chronic to apparentlyjack again

##### 1-0

chronic to appjack is a little more boring this time, and gen.g are in the lead in game two

bang

##### 2-0

sypical misses a free double wide left, mist misses the rebound wide left. first must be fuming

jamesbot rhyming as appjack makes faze pay for their lack of shooting

gen.g have now swept faze in back-to-back series, seven games on the trot for them. wild
