# 0-1: Falcons - James Cheese

don't really know how this would be anything besides a 3-0. apparently kamii couldn't play for two weeks pre-major because of computer & travel issues

##### 0-0

falcons score immediately, but james cheese get it together, keeping it to 1-0 and maybe even having the advantage for stretches of game. the physical play was their best chance, virt still does have the demo meta within him. cheese looked better than against karmine and nearly got the result out of it

##### 1-0

cheese give up another early freebie, and we might just never really see what they can do with a neutral scoreline

it takes until they go down 3-0, but cheese eventually break the duck with a kickoff goal. they will not be perfect swept out of the tournament! and they follow it up with a goal in the run of play, and it ends a one goal game instead of three

##### 2-0

three games in a row of falcons scoring immediately, and they run it up again, with a khalid triple tap cementing the series

# 1-0: Oxygen - Gen.G

joreuz/appjack revenge, but joreuz has home field advantage. tbates still hasn't bet right, and he picked gen.g...

##### 0-0

that's a wild catch/handff/fake

well this series is over already (they score on the following counter)

chronic was pretty invisible

##### 1-0

appjack goes for a prejump early, they're not cowed...but appjack is playing terribly otherwise, oxygen go up early and seem on cruise control

archie prejump! <iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=GoldenDoubtfulStrawberrySaltBae-1h5z8Yp_yW32h-qT&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

appjack missed an open net...

chronic again in the sub-200 crew, oaly bossed the game

##### 2-0

chronic starts a couple solo plays, but no finishes fron appjack, and he's a lan choker and oxygen pull ahead again

...i think this was intentional <iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=RacyFreezingAmazonPeoplesChamp-NC9J3chD07MT-2dQ&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

appjack whiffs a clear, it's 4-0, and this is a sweep with a pure appjack choke 

# 0-1: PWR - G2

g2 looked even with oxygen, who smashed gen.g. pwr had some serious issues, and apparently their more recent scrim results were an issue and they're out of confidence. g2 favored for a 3-0

##### 0-0

g2 start with all the pressure, but torsos nails a backchecking pass and pwr actually take the lead

i wish i could clip the goal steal by torsos - he demos the goalie and scores in his recoil, and pwr up 2-0 early? make that 3-0, and bonus points for chicago crossbarring a rookie-training open net followed by jknaps whiffing a back wall clear, and now it's 4-0

##### 1-0

amphis air dribble bumps jknaps for goal 1...

torsos to amphis to fever to amphis and g2 are on the ropes!

if g2 could throw some mechs out there they'd be fine. pwr can't help themselves biting on air dribbles and passes and such, but g2 can't turn that into misdirectional dribbles or resets, so pwr are just recovering in-line and blocking anyway. g2 need to show something beyond guile to win this series

##### 2-0

pwr start a little slower, but the middle two minutes are all pressure on the g2 backline, with g2 being starved, slow, or both for large chunks. late in regulation a wild stretch: fever runs out of boost on a double, g2 just miss a passing play, then amphis completes the air dribble bump pass against atomic, who then flies out and bumps the shooter to keep it level!

amphis passes from the far wall to a prejumping fever in overtime for the winner! g2 to the 0-2 round!

# 1-0: Liquid - Version1

another na/eu matchup. liquid are _fast_, eu mechanics so far have looked unbeatable, but v1 are aggressive and have a great record early in majors. weird seeing them in orange tho

##### 0-0

oski can't nail a musty, and beastmode gets free reign the other direction, and that's a mistake

coming off pwr-g1 i feel like i'm watching a different sport. this is lightning quick, end to end, so many resets and wall dashes and aerial plays. look how fast the decision making needs to be
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=FuriousWisePorpoiseCoolStoryBob--QiJ3iLVisx6yerj&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

v1 survive, this looks like a great series

##### 0-1

game two is the same level of quality, but much more demo focused than game one. you'd assume that would favor v1, but liquid are equal to it

we're two minutes into ot and liquid have nailed every touch but the final one, unbelievable saves from v1 have kept them in it but liquid need to be hitting some top corners on their strikes

three full games in one. how are we still going? <iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=CrowdedShinyDragonfruitDuDudu-HONIHXyvZxf-rjJ2&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

lan records: 22 shots from liquid, beastmode with 11 saves in a losing effort. v1 for 18 team saves, second longest OT

##### 1-1

of course now v1 score early, liquid's turn to chase the game, but v1 settle in and make it an easy runaway by halftime

##### 1-2

acronik's reads high off his defensive backboard are inconsistent, v1 have had a few successful drives off missed touches up there

this is sick <iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SolidSparklyAubergineYouWHY-33CrUCs8PzN8jgzS&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

##### 2-2

not a lot of game 5s today, but this one is well deserved and i'm glad we've made it here. i feel like this series is more important for liquid than v1, i think v1 have a lower risk of spiraling out

liquid have a little better game control, but this time instead of not being able to turn shots into goals they can't turn possession into good shots. they're bunching up so close together

<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=FantasticPiercingGarageBibleThump-F-arfkGxSNnuSNk3&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

that's the series, v1 to the 2-0 bracket, very composed gameplay against a liquid that weren't quite popping off

# 0-1: Quadrant - Secret

this is why i like majors. a weird middle tier matchup for both teams. quadrant probably the favorite, but they're not exactly lanboys so far. wave and eekso looked pretty bad earlier, and wave really struggled in endpoint's lans last season. dunno if secret really have what it takes, they got pretty wrecked by liquid, which transitively puts them below quadrant who played even with v1 for a couple games

##### 0-0

i don't think either of these teams are very good, or at least not very warmed up. wave continues to look panicky, and secret gets the first goal off a standard air dribble

secret hold it with one great save and a very slow pace, they looked kinda like pre-beastmode v1, and that's not a huge compliment

##### 0-1

eekso messes up goal-line positioning, secret wear down the now-broken rotation, and they lead with an open net

the lead is doubled when kv1 dribbles high on the quadrant back wall and flips a hard pass down to sad, quadrant are a blank stare

eekso finally puts one on the board for quadrant with a cheeky corner play, but it's too little too late

##### 0-2

panic stations for quadrant, they've not been able to impose on secret at all. quadrant did get a few posts that could make this closer, but it never feels like they're gonna hit a multi-goal stretch if they keep playing this dull

eekso screws _another_ clear, and nxghtt buries another early goal for secret

wave and eekso both miss touches, and secret go up 3-1. quadrant do get 19 shots in this final game, but secret make all the saves and it's ggs. quadrant to 0-2, secret join pwr in neutralizing their game score against all odds

# 1-0: Moist - The Club

can lostt really show up moist? can moist follow up the faze win?

##### 0-0

a feeler game from both sides, each team looks pretty good even if the goals are a little scrappy. looks an even series from here <iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=UninterestedObliviousMarjoramHassaanChop-xWZYo8_r0riiGxn_&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

##### 1-0

moist are making their living off defense and challenges, which is odd to say given their mechanical history, but they can't keep lostt quiet forever
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=InquisitiveBillowingTurnipStinkyCheese-LpLiMj3pXW6lgQua&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

this series is more of a grind than expected, from both sides, but the club ride that lost goal and some bemmz defense to level the series

##### 1-1

aztral's turn for a solo play
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=PlayfulVibrantTaroHotPokket-CRdp_Jk_FjsrVL4M&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

moist have changed to rotate two very close together to play for challenge losses. the club are trying to counter that by then bumping the second/third men, but can't get anything from it and moist beat them with their own trick to ice the game

##### 2-1

an all out assault finally breaks the moist dam
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BashfulUnsightlyDillHeyGirl-ZB6Q6h0OCsrIRxLp&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>


lets go to 5, what an overcommit by moist, what a breakout by the club
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BrightWanderingClintKevinTurtle-DRdkDynrf8gMtCkN&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

##### 2-2

bemmz gives up a tilter, as he doesn't expect a second touch from joyo and an easy one trickles in

rise with a bump and doink
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=WanderingAliveBisonHeyGuys-ibI2p6V3xZghQO1a&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

the club just can't find the offense. lostt v 3 never really materializes, and the club will sink to the 1-1 round. moist with a couple good wins so far

# 0-1: Pioneers - Faze Clan

the test here will be if faze are still on tilt from the moist series. if not? 3-0 faze. if so? could get interesting

##### 0-0

okay it's gonna be a faze sweep, they immediately launch into ~two~ three very good goals, including a mist quintuple tap

pioneers have a great minute and score a pair, but faze don't collapse on the first bit of pressure. all business on their side

##### 0-1

first calls off mist as mist is about to make a save, and first doesn't keep it out. pioneers score first...

faze even it, but superlachie nails a fast double to culminate a spell of pressure. kickoff resets the pressure though, and faze get an easy equalizer. they're really heavy on the defensive side, inviting pioneers and daring them to score

overtime ends with a faze aerial bump. i though pioneers deserved it, but faze eke it out and are on the verge of the sweep

##### 0-2

firstkiller with a huge air dribble from the high midfield wall, and faze are comfortable again. i thought this series was more of a 3-1 than a sweep, but faze took it comfortably either way

# 1-1: Karmine Corp - Spacestation

kc looked fine to good against james cheese, ssg played a high-wire match against falcons and came out on top. kc's first lan test here

##### 0-0

first goal is an empty net in favor of ssg, but kc score two in ten seconds and lead after a minute

a sick fake evens it up

and daniel evens it up again

best player in the world?

##### 1-0

vatira, man
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=EmpathicWiseHornetMingLee-vEB3TyoNwNTb-DE4&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

ssg crumble in this one, with lj providing the assist on vati's double and arsenal whiffing a couple times to make it 5-1

##### 2-0

they trade galaxy brain decoys and delayed challenges early to make it 1-1, but kc score the next with a demo, and the next with a bump, but daniel scores twice on gambles in the box to tie it up late

danielllllll

ssg probably did deserve a game. they'll have to play better than that to get another one

##### 2-1

kc's first shot of the game comes with 0 seconds, and i have no idea how it isn't the winner. on to OT!
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ObeseCautiousPizzaPoooound-U8oexWfoxiXw3216&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

kc ends it just moments into the overtime, and move to the 2-0 round against moist, which is a great revenge series
