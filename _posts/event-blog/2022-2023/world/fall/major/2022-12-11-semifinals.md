there's a ten minute break between quarters and semis, so moist will be back in with only like an hour break, but we're starting with the NA side

# Gen.G - Faze

faze had gen.g's number in regional one, then gen.g has basically swept them since

##### 0-0

...jack starts with an own goal. are his yips back?

and that's the only goal. noly also had a double commit backpass, so gen.g had a couple yikes moments there

##### 0-1

some normal goals going in, nothing too meaningful, then faze double commit in their own corner and appjack sneaks a challenge off an unknowing firstkiller, and suddenly the yips are gone and gen.g are two goals up. appjack leading the line well at this point

faze rally to make it a 4-3 game, but no one can pop off for the equalizer and we have a tied series, quiet so far

##### 1-1

well, that was a game

##### 2-1

sick passing play when the pressure's on

faze again needs to press for a zero second equalizer, and this time sypical doesn't have the boost to place the shot top corner and the ball falls harmlessly

faze takes a timeout and noly joins the viking clap during the break 

##### 3-1

oh boy chronic's here

faze put on the extended press for the first time this series, and it's rewarded when first wraps all the way around that backbard ball

gen.g just have faze's number

the reign of fourth clan continues, gen.g makes another grand final and are likely favored again

# Moist - Secret

i've been seeing secret as the underdog all tourney, and i don't really see that changing now. moist beat karmine, secret beat version1. the only problem is that uh secret beat moist 3-1 a couple days ago...

##### 0-0

uh oh that's an early one

secret get on the board with a wicked early read from kv1 off some nice back wall work, game on

moist dodge a late bump attempt and they win a solid game one

##### 1-0

it's a tense one, but secret straight whiff a late clear, and moist might get a short series before the finals

##### 2-0

moist don't respect secret

##### 3-1

scrappy, ugly, whatever. secret get outshot 12-4 but win in overtime off an awkward deflection. can they do it again?

##### 3-2

joyo sideflips for secret's first goal, then secret torch two rotations and moist are up within the first minute

this game is a mess. a bump from secret for the equalizer is followed by a bad kv1 prejump for the moist lead and a full field bump play to double it

in the end, secret just don't have the juice. moist make yet another major final, and it's up and down. their swiss performance is up and down, they beat karmine corp convincingly and secret less so. idk i think gen.g have been playing better, only a fully aflame oxygen were able to put them off their pace
