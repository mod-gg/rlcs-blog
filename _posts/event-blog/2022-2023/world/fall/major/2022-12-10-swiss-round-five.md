# 2-2: Liquid - PWR

pwr are heavy, heavy underdogs, but liquid really only had one good tournament so far. 

##### 0-0

that's a starter

do it again son

pwr do start to figure out how to press, and build into a goal

##### 1-0

what a recovery

##### 2-0

pwr look pretty good, but liquid won't let them get away easy
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=VastSecretiveOtterPraiseIt-aulTn4CCKKnnQA66&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

for once pwr don't succumb to the pressure, and we get a game four

##### 2-1

what a great back post passing play
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=OutstandingCautiousLobsterTTours-OKqvnGy-uddMxl2b&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

excellent handoff/fake
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=FlaccidHelpfulPhonePrimeMe-O30OLkXKZl218gS9&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

we're gonna get a round five game five - five minutes for everything, and it's even a potential reverse sweep to boot

##### 2-2

how does oski dig this one out
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SwissRefinedOcelotPeanutButterJellyTime-hSYVSr06NP7VU59w&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

okay, maybe oski is better than pwr
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SmoothFantasticChickenYee-YOIbsjQccEM7wdNi&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

when it all came down to it, pwr wasn't quite good enough. inconsistency alternated between comms and mechanics, and they needed both on point to beat the more talented team

# 2-2: Spacestation - Faze Clan

in the gap between matches violentpanda retires, revealing he had injuries in both thumbs at the start of rlcsx and couldn't keep up from there. he gets a meaningful send-off from the dutch crowd. he proposes on-stage to boot, and there's a big celebration. good for panda

faze is probably the slight favorite here? but they haven't looked incredible in swiss so far, not quite on their game

##### 0-0

this is a really tricky overhead shot

faze speed up a little bit and take a (briefly held) lead
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SavoryDistinctOctopusCharlieBitMe-yl2Qkkhxl8AdNc0L&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

insane ceiling reset from the man himself

##### 0-1

syp gets an early dunk goal from a wide angle, i swear ssg is outplaying faze but it ain't happening for them

##### 0-2

lj gets a dunk goal, arsenal gets a breakaway, and ssg are up two in forty seconds

this is full speed insanity

##### 1-2

faze learn how to avoid the key ssg demos and bait ssg into some bad challenges. faze get yet another top 8

# 2-2: Moist - G2

no one's ever happy to be here, but these two are especially so

##### 0-0

joyo dusts chicago, dunks atomic, and the series has a goal

moist can't collect at zero seconds, but they can in the overtime

##### 1-0

g2 get three goals in a minute, and this series will probably be even

##### 1-1

lol

that might be the goal of swiss

faked so hard it hurts

##### 1-2

it looked like moist were done and dusted, but they somehow force the ace match anyway

##### 2-2

getting messy in game five

atomic and jknaps just a little bit faster

TOO STRONG
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=HumbleUglyStrawberryRlyTho-4573RQBcFzRajPgm&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

aztral put the team on his back
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AmericanSuspiciousVanillaHotPokket-WTQ_pVnDiNbBusLK&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

aztral with a 900 pointer: 4 saves, 3 goals. jknaps missed a great chance to level it at threes and got immediately punished

# Wrapup

33 matches and we knocked out half the teams. eu domination, with both top seeds, 4/8 teams overall. seeds:

1. Karmine Corp
2. Oxygen
3. Gen.G
4. Secret
5. Version1
6. Liquid
7. Faze
8. Moist

so we get the immediate vatira/aztral swap showdown, no na intra-conference showdowns
