# 2-1: Version1 - PWR

can OCE get their first top 8 since rlcsx? probably not! but maybeeeeee

##### 0-0

torsos _has_ to put that shot to either side, but instead he drills it down the middle and v1's counter ends in a wicked beastmode angle

##### 1-0

torsos has had some great mechs, but he whiffs a long save and that's two big mistakes so far this series

not great for pwr

##### 2-0

pretty slick pass

v1 perfect sweep pwr to earn a middle seed for sunday. ggwp pretty easy

# 2-1: Moist - Secret

not really sure how secret made it here, they'll have to figure out a way to throw a wrench into moist in a new way. also rise speaks portuguese, so if he pops off you can bet secret are gonna hear about it

##### 0-0

nxghtt has gotten about 3 1v1s and managed to score one of them. that was enough, because secret outpaced moist and held them to three shots. wild

##### 0-1

what a pass from aztral

how

kv1 can't quite get the right clear, and joyo slots it. even series now

##### 1-1

perfect challenge by nxghtt, he's their best player
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=OilyPrettiestCormorantThunBeast-lQH8HezcSiK4jTMs&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

nxghtt follows that up by saving a 1v2 waterfall with a pre-jump. flow state

this is a clinical defensive stand, and sad with the dagger

##### 1-2

3:18 of defending, 0:01 for the pinch challenge

nxghtt sets up everything

quadrant down. ssg down. moist down. secret through. what a run, what a series of upsets. 

# 2-1: Gen.G - Faze Clan

one of the top two na seeds will go through, the other will be unexpectedly in the final round of swiss. faze was winning this matchup early, but gen.g took their last matchup and even the game record between the two. this _should_ be a sick matchup

##### 0-0

chronic looking good early

##### 1-0

chronic to appjack is a little more boring this time, and gen.g are in the lead in game two

bang

##### 2-0

sypical misses a free double wide left, mist misses the rebound wide left. first must be fuming

jamesbot rhyming as appjack makes faze pay for their lack of shooting

gen.g have now swept faze in back-to-back series, seven games on the trot in this matchup. oxygen beat em clean, but otherwise gen.g went 9-1 in swiss against faze/falcons/pwr, pretty good pretty good

--

crowd is here! they split swiss round four over two days so they could get the crowd in for every elimination match (except the 0-3s, sorry james cheese & kansas city pioneers). it looks pretty packed in there!

# 1-2: The Club - Spacestation

the desk picks 4-1 for the club, which i find at least interesting. lj hasn't been a star, ssg has mostly been a daniel carry show, but the club haven't exactly popped yet either

##### 0-0

ssg nails a kickoff goal, and we're off!

arsenal catches em napping and he's getting loud early

uh, club?

lostt still hasn't totally awoken, but this is a start

lostt misses a double, daniel misses a double, but only one is allowed to punish the other's mistake

_insane_ pre-jump

##### 1-2

i _really_ hope the club can force five

it's tense, it's scoreless late, but ssg are the ones who make it through. the club were a little jumpy, they were a little awkward, and ssg were just there. not sure ssg are favored to move through, but y'never'know

# 1-2: Liquid - Quadrant

apparently kash has earned the nickname "the cannon" which is maybe the most fun thing about quadrant in this matchup

##### 0-0

quadrant is slow, eekso whiffs and liquid takes a two goal lead with relative ease. people have a habit of shitting on relatingwave - he hadn't won a lan series since seikoo, even though he's qualified for all of them - but i'd argue eekso has been worse in this tourney. at least wave has to be under pressure all the time

quadrant at least put on some pressure and get a late goal, but it's too late and we're on to game two

##### 1-0

some great plays before the goal, the goal is nearly anticlimactic, but quadrant will take it

##### 1-1

oh what a save from eekso

##### 2-1

quadrant haven't had much offense so far, only a few shots 

OSKI

wave misses a sitter set up by the cannon, and lando norris's boys can't keep up with liquid. goodnight quadrant, see you next split

# 1-2: Falcons - G2

wooooooof for both of these squads. it's gonna be tough looking back and seeing secret go through while one of these teams doesn't (never mind who gets elim'd in the 2-2), but deserve ain't got nothin to do with it

##### 0-0

ahmad lit up g2 when sandrock rocked g2 last fall, and he opens it up again
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=TiredSplendidGooseDAESuppy-SHAvwxTKzc5RtLK8&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

can't remember the last time chicago earned a clip, but he helps put g2 in front with a sick redirect

##### 0-1

demos left and right (6 from g2, 4 by ahmad alone) lead to a frantic finish
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AnnoyingFancyTapirRitzMitz--GDtVygQFUC9JoD4&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

##### 0-2

chicago hits a kickoff goal, and falcons are on the ropes

it's early, but this is probably it. falcons look slow, jknaps looks _fast_
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=BusyCarefulRingLeeroyJenkins-dMcFehZaW-dGrBkM&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

trk at least scores a nice one
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=WonderfulCooperativeLapwingTakeNRG-UrxOYxmapL67nmkv&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

unreal pinch goal, and the comeback is on
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=TrustworthyDignifiedLatteWholeWheat-y92J2AvjqcRJE2wC&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

in the end it's too many giveaways from okhalid. falcons at their best were fast, played into space, and surprised their opponents with their speed. this tournament they had none of that, and neither trk nor ahmad were able to make up the difference with solo plays. a real shocker for falcons, this made it look like they were past their prime. a _real_ shame nwpo got himself suspended for a year for playing on someone else's account, rule one would be so fun to watch if they could push past falcons but i don't think they're good enough without him.
