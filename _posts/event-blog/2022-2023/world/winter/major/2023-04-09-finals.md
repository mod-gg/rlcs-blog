- worlds in dusseldorf, germany
- today's format: semis and finals back to back. single elim, guaranteed for an na-eu final

# Karmine Corp - Liquid

this has been the EU final three times already this year, with liquid winning the winter invitational. karmine will feel disappointed to not make it farther than this if it happens, but liquid also seem deserving given their recent win. if kc can pull it off, they'll clinch a spot at worlds

kcorp suffocate liquid in game one. no chance for liquid to gain space or strut mechanics. it was only 1-0 but liquid barely had a chance

this feels impossible, but apparently of the semifinalists only vatira has won a major already - all a bunch of newbs out here at this high of a level

so clean, karmine corp refuse to let liquid get too close

**atow says otherwise**

liquid made a run, but vatira snuffed it out, and this series is effectively over

in the break between matches atow's fun fact is `i want to main the batmobile but my team doesn't want to`

okay this is pretty sweet though

uh, kcorp? y'all know the series isn't over, right? liquid putting together some wicked passes now

okay, vatira woke up, that'll be all

# Complexity - Faze

a spaniard, a chilean, and an argentine walk into a semifinal against three of the best that the usa has to offer

mist starts us off, and complexity are in trouble early

fk spikes the bull!

mist makes a great save, and then faze poop their own pants

bump everyody

every goal in the first couple game of this series felt like an overtime winner. the intensity and pressure so high at all points. post-timeout though faze score two freebies, and that might open up the series a bit

vamos!

complexity have had the balance of chances, and now el toro capitalizes
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ConsideratePiliableSwanCorgiDerp-zAXUT-iebOiinUo0&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

i swear complexity had better chances throughout neo tokyo, but faze made every save (and complexity hit some tame shots) and we go to champions field. i think complexity are tight, against historical odds i favor faze here

mist with the stones, and faze take the lead!

complexity ran out of boost at the crucial moments, and faze clan will make a major final

# Karmine Corp - Faze

for the first time in the circuit era we get a grand final of #1 vs #1. no idea who to favor here, just hoping for a banger of a series

without shogun and johnny around we get dazerin and stax on the call, shouts to umaine

oh sypical noooo

what a slot
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AntsySpikySushiPermaSmug-Mtr-ZDLVsmM1GBRS&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

the tension in this match is insane, kcorp's timeout pays off when itachi pulls this corner play into a pretty air dribble
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=EnticingArtisticReindeerTTours-lFJENQ_mlL0wzUoY&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

kcorp run up a seven spot in that game, and firstkiller leaves the stage for a couple minutes after the match? when you gotta go you gotta go

they don't start game five well either...

nevermind!
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=KindExpensiveNarwhalPeteZarollTie-viuPHld8wwbFUfFK&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

VATIIIIII

so i guess faze still had a timeout? i assumed they were forced to use it when fk peaced out for backstage

fk nooooooooooooooooooo
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SecretiveProductiveSandstormPeanutButterJellyTime-IKpvWsGCUH0_paUc&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

karmine corp get their deserved win, and fk continues his bid for best player to never win a lan. rough for the whole faze crew, this really seemed to be their best shot. on to spring split, where i've already seen some _spicy_ roster rumors, plus the guarantee of **zen**
