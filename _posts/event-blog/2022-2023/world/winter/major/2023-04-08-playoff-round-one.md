the two seeds vs the three seeds from each group to separate 9th-12th from the top 8

# Secret - KRU

we get a guaranteed SAM top 8, but which sam team will it be? secret are heavy favorites both from online and lan performances, seven series in a row for secret over kru

crushed that the pinch didn't go, but what a low air dribble from sadness for the only goal of the match

kv1 with an unorthodox bulldozing 1v3

secret win back-to-back 1-0 games, even as kru pushes hard in the final seconds each time, and it never looks that dicey. 8 saves, while kru only had 2, but secret will take it

kru have scored five straight over a game and a half, and secret look shellshocked

kru pull the reverse sweep! first reverse sweep on lan for a sam team, and it's over a sam team. secret have to be gutted on this one, it's the first time they've ever lost to kru

# Falcons - Gen.G

a weird elimination match to see this early. gen.g notoriously get better in the playoffs, but falcons looked better than gen.g did yesterday

trk is in form, and this match is Good

gen.g caught ahmad out as third man for the winner in game one and now again the opener in game two, falcons too jumpy and pressing hard when they shouldn't be

it's gonna need to be a reverse sweep, but falcons look up for it so far

this little move from trk to take air by posting himself so he can get the delayed flip is wiiild, and well rewarded. gen.g go next

ahmad puts gen.g on a poster

falcons get their first demo in like eight minutes, and ahmad pays it off

falcons win a shocker, in that it's 1-0 instead of a full brazil. champions field beckons, falcons on the verge of a reverse sweep!

noly with the weave!

that'll do it, gen.g somehow emerge with an ugly victory, and falcons take yet another early exit

# Oxygen - Vitality

this is a wicked close one, the 3 & 4 seeds from EU. i'd favor oxygen, but that's only because i haven't seen alpha pop as much as the casters seem to say

vitality going all-in early in game one, and it pays off

cheeky from radosin, he's carrying them so far with a 750 point game one and now the opening goal

oxygen get smushed, and now _they'll_ have to reverse sweep to move to top 8. huge disappointment, and from my basic understanding, just awful gameplanning and awareness from them as vitality have shut down the solo channels and oxygen don't know how to move the ball forward anymore

saizen acting like dreakhack chausette out here

joreuz lurks, rise nails the pass, oxygen stretch it to game four

vitality take it in four, and even with rise back in from his wrist injury oxygen can't convert online to lan. they'll feel awfully disappointed, and we're all gonna be left wondering if players like archie and joreuz are gonna be able to play at the highest level

# Ground Zero - G2

if g2 don't sweep this...

jknaps doink, this series is unfair
