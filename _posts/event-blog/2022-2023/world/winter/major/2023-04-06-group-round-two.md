# Group C: Secret - Gladiators

secret are not the kind of team to dominate an inferior opponent, and game one goes to 0-0 OT but secret do pull it out in the end. then it sprials out into a sweep, which makes sense


# Group C: Liquid - Ground Zero

projected liquid sweep, gz didn't look great, let's find out

the passing play sticks crisply, and liquid lead

gz can't find anything, and we're fast forwarding this series too. this group is two good teams and two bad teams

# Group A: KRU - Faze Clan

projected faze sweep, b stream status confirmed, potential ff early

kru do catch faze overcommitting to take a game one lead, but faze make themselves a lot of space and score a quick pair to take game one

faze skip the overcommit part in game two and move straight to the quick pair of goals. mist ends up scoring five in game two, most of them sick including a kuxir pinch from deep in his own territory. this game alone could give him a highlight reel

# Group A: G2 - G1

the mirror battle! g2-g1! atomic-atomik! the poor casters on this one are gonna have a nightmare

g1 immediately look slower and more boost starved. g2 might have a severe tactical advantage in this one

the first four goals of the series are all scored by atomi(ck)s, goal five will have to settle for being produced by a ridiculous in-and-out pass from atomik while in g2's net

g2's tactical advantage is gone - g1 start bumping and demoing a little more efficiently and make it a low boost battle on both sides, grinding out a game three win and heading to match point. g2 not quite impeccable with their touch right now and ending up in scramble situations like this one

the play starts with atomik sealing off atomic and ends with atomik burying a freebie

uh oh, g1 ship a pair and it's game on

huuuuuuge dunk

atomik lets one over his head, and g2 even it up. in OT dorito misses the ceiling read, and g2 score _four_ off of g1 mistakes to take game four. g1 seem to just melt sometimes, and this was a pretty bad one

this is a match of tilt right now. chicago's made a couple goalkeeping errors in the series now

g1 are gonna regret that series, they had it in their hands several times and let it slip in increasingly frustrating ways. g1 could have won the group right here, and now they'll be playing in a difficult section of bracket

# Group B: Oxygen - Pioneers

this should continue the sweep train on b-stream. let's find out!

only 1-0 in game one, but not seeing much out of pioneers

kcp dominate the first two minutes of game two, and it's 1-1 at halftime with kcp outplaying oxygen

it takes overtime for game two

kcp would rather i don't talk about game three. sweep stream continues

i don't think superlachie was the problem! 

# Group D: Complexity - Gen.G

complexity started the season with gen.g's number, but gen.g have fought back recently to take the last few matches, so gen.g are still gonna have to be favored

noly's such a great passer

what an impeccable 1-2 from crr & el toro, that's aggression and precision all in one

complexity win the match and win the group! wins over oxygen and gen.g have them as group stage champs, no doubt. vamooooooooos

karmine corp move to 51-2 this split when scoring first in a game, and three one goal games go their way. falcons will be battling in the middle of this group
