the crowd is here!

# Group D: Complexity - Pioneers

complexity are already tops in the group, and pioneers don't yet have a game win and are already eliminated. bananahead is playing in the _scarab_. might not post much on this one

complexity let pioneers get a game, for fun, and then rout them otherwise

# Group B: Ground Zero - Gladiators

one of these teams has to go through, not sure which is likely to deserve it. i guess gz will be favored, but gladiators looked much better than gz pre-tournament

that's kinda sick from osm? gladiators score again to take the lead...

still sad about superlachie leaving pioneers

ignore the goal, watch superlachie's face cam. poor osm

# Group D: Oxygen - Gen.G

oxygen wiped the floor with gen.g in the fall major, can they do it again and send gen.g to the third seed in their own group?

gen.g get smashed in game one, but game two looks like it'll produce jack's first game win _ever_ over joreuz

joreuz took that loss personally

clipping with pre-jumps, oxygen style

gen.g absolutely kill game four - the one goal is a noly sharp angle from the corner on what feels like their only shot, jack got 98 points in a win - and force a game five against the run of play

archie with a perfect soft dropdown

oxygen take games 1, 3, and 5, each by 3+ goals, and they'll earn second place in the group over gen.g. the reigning champs take third, and it doesn't feel undeserved either

# Group C: Liquid - Secret

despite these two each being 2-0 liquid are pretty heavily favored here. secret know how to kill a game though...

oski says nah

this is why liquid are favored

secret some out on game two a little better than game one, what a fat challenge from nxghtt

liquid snipe game two in an OT 1v1, so secret start game three with a lead all over again from a nice nxghtt touch

secret get a deserved game. liquid won't be bothered yet, but glad it wasn't a sweep

BURY HIM KV1
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AbnegatePoisedPassionfruitRickroll-H-2sspp6ZQTBF_c9&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

1. i _love_ this spaceman-achieves broadcast. they both trip over themselves a good amount but they're really pointing out important analysis during the game without losing the play-by-play, impeccable work
2. secret win two straight 1-0 games by consolidating the defense, requiring liquid to attack centrally, and hitting on the counter when liquid forget how to manage their boost. gonna be _really_ hard to repeat a third time in a row though
3. wild that secret can look completely shattered by the liquid pace and then make, like, two rotational changes and shut them out two games in a row. secret are so good at winning challenges forward that they bait teams into fighting that same fight, then secret collect because they're positioned for those challenge types more than their opponent

large oscar gets revenge

# Group B: Falcons - Dignitas

falcons _have_ to win this one, it's too important and they've already done the hard work against the europeans

gonna be real tough for dig if they give space like this
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ResoluteRespectfulDolphinMrDestructoid-RthDJoEI3ShWhhHg&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

andy in particular looks shook out here, no idea what he's doing on all three falcons goals

ahmad hits dig with the hesi, and this is getting out of hand
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SweetHorribleLarkBleedPurple-GQU-fM6mqr0fCJu1&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

5-0 at the 2:00 mark, sheesh. dig can skip game three, just put down the controllers, there's no use

update: 14-2 in aggregate

# Group A: KRU - G1

g1 looked great day 1, but are notoriously inconsistent. kru probably aren't good enough to capitalize, but it might not be a sweep?

kru and drufinho getting a little pep in their step

i have no idea who is going through from this group, it comes down to g2/faze

# Group B: Karmine Corp - Vitality

vitality could go top of group with a dominant win, but kc are definitely gonna be the strong favorite to earn the bye

vitality clutch up early
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=ResoluteDoubtfulVultureWOOP-VvmzhLNS3Lg9DMTL&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

only kc's third loss of the split when scoring first in a game, dropping the record to 51-3

how does this pass slot through the defense? impeccably accurate
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=WanderingFaithfulNeanderthalItsBoshyTime-Hq8B7KXBjgKy8ZSZ&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

ground passes are the new meta, and karmine have awoken

vati's waving goodbye halfway through game three!

# G2 - Faze

this determines both top of the group and who gets elimintated, so it's a worthy hammer match of the day. g1 will root for g2, kru for faze

faze win the first two games easy, but atomic launches an absolute bullet in game three for g2's first lead
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SavoryGloriousBatDoggo-PHLu4zu2oDUXqHRW&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

here comes firstkiller

faze more or less cruise through that matchup, taking first in the group and knocking out g1. g2 could just never get the demo game or the passing game going, so they were incredibly easy to defend
