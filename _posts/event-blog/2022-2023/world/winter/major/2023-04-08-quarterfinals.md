two quarterfinals today, two tomorrow, all wrapped into one post

# Liquid - Vitality

vitality have somehow picked up a reputation as fiesty underdogs, but liquid are a team that could genuinely win the whole thing and would be disappointed to fall short of top four

vitality haven't beat liquid yet this year, but this might change fast

how do you react to that? what do you do? how is that the winner? liquid on match point

acronik is single-handedly keeping air dribbling alive

liquid escape a horrific touch from acronik leading to a massive scramble and _bury_ vitality

# Karmine Corp - G2

karmine in a way underachieved in the fall major, they'll probably need to reach the grand finals to feel satisfied with this split. g2 would need an equivalent run to keep up their every-other-major pattern

karmine clobber g2 in game one, two teams playing at different speeds. g2 batten down the hatches in game two, but exotiik lurks on a broken play ang g2 take a deserved timeout

it's the exotiik show. first the banger of a double, then the deftest of passes

atomic pops off hard and carries g2 to a second game win. can he do it again?

kcorp don't let g2 go anywhere in game six, barely needing to make a single save, and g2 exit in front of the home crowd

# Complexity - KRÜ

new day, same round. championship sunday includes these two quarterfinals, and complexity will feel like they deserve this one

it starts as you'd expect, but kru throw an early spanner in the works
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=CheerfulVastCurlewHeyGuys-08ho9pBewHB-oHgm&parent=www.example.com" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

obviously this is a sick passing play, but keep a close eye on reysbull's shot from the previous attack. he reads the clear attempt before kru even hit it, and it's only by a hair that complexity even have to attack again. when they do, it's impeccable teamwork, and the reaction matches the quality

kru can't do nothin about the bull

ajg go to your room, that's rude

kru buckle down defensively and drag out the last games, but can't get a win on the board and complexity will take a deserving top four

# Gen.G - Faze

i know it's passé to say `this feels like a grand final` but, this has literally been multiple grand finals on the NA side. someone's going home earlier than they thought they would and on form, it's probably the transplants taking the L

apparentlyjack starts us off

how do you give firstkiller this much time
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=MotionlessFuriousSandstormBloodTrail-kZugl_tEDndaGrJy&parent=www.example.com" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

gen.g mess up the fake kickoff, and faze win game one going away. gen.g just didn't have the touch in this game, nor the rotational ideals. faze won and looked like they could have done more

well there's some momentum

gen.g win game two against their own mechanics. neither team deserved this one

gen.g are cooking themselves, and faze keep stoking that fire

the level of aerial control from first is obscene

i love glances like this

i keep thinking appjack is playing poorly, and then he does things like this

i actually _do_ think apparently jack is playing really poorly. he's missing a lot of touches, and has been caught out of rotation several times. he's getting bailed out by this being a sloppy series overall and by noly plugging a load of holes because, i suspect, he _knows_ jack is gonna keep going for touches he's not super likely to nail. this might just be what appjack is - someone who plays at the peak mechanical level whether he deserves to or not, and his chutzpah and reputation and team all turn that into a good decision instead of a comedy of errors

mist dances on the ceiling like it's nothing

faze put up six goals in two minutes eleven seconds, and they'll get the first crack at match point once gen.g take their inevitable timeout

a game six overtime feels never ending. gen.g keep racking up _impeccable_ shooting positions, then flubbing the finishes. wave after wave of pressure being finished with meek 20mph shots, and then this happens
