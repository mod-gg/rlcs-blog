# Pre-Tournament News
- the break was extra long to line this up with dreamhack, which might make for some grumpy teams and weird results
- falcons faced a real challenger in MENA this split, with rule one taking the third regional _and_ saudi eleague, the last two tournaments each played. falcons might be at their lowest point in years, but maybe a good challenge will inspire them higher?
- rise played regional three with a cast and sling for his busted wrist, but he should be in good health at this point
- james cheese got beat! markydooda went to coach gladiators and GG dueled with the imports all split before making the major in game seven of the regional finals, so they'll rep APAC this split
- a pre-major tourney had kru beating dignitas and ground zero, so maybe they can scrape themselves out of the bottom
- caster drama: only stumpy, chamako, and cjcj were able to make it to san diego for the non-na caster crew, we're missing a lot of talent there
- it's nearly zen time. he's something like 30-1 in 1s showmatches in the last few weeks, only losing to rw9 once and knocking off basically the entire top 10. his shadow hangs over vitality always
- no clips from the b-stream still, psyonix fail as usual on this front

# Group C: Ground Zero - Secret

OCE always seems to knock off SAM, with renegades over furia being a particular sore spot. secret actually enters as the four seed overall and top seed in the group after their top-4 finish in fall, so we'll see if they can reverse the trend. GZ brought in superlachie from pioneers and romped their way to top seed, maybe pioneers made a mistake...

game one starts with gz giving up a kickoff goal and two counterattacks by pushing up too high. this is the secret wheelhouse

it looked like gz took momentum by nearly tying up game one in the dying seconds, but secret start game two fresh and gz can't get out of their own way

sad carves em up (i think he's the only kbm player at this lan, which rules)

well that'll end that

even in a wicked weak group, can't feel good about that for gz, they might face a real problem with gladiators

# Group C: Liquid - Gladiators

not really watching this unless something weird happens

osm scores first for gladiators, and then suddenly it's 5-2 liquid. game two is a brazil, game three is only 4-2 to liquid

# Group A: G1 - Faze Clan

g1 are one of those teams with a lot of weaknesses and a few wicked strengths (speed, mostly). if faze have truly turned a corner they'll pick 'em apart, but maybe they haven't? atomik is rated as top 5 in the world by octane rating this split so could be a real showdown

dorito-atomik show out early, and firstkiller needs to adjust his monitor a bit

marc_by_8 hits his first lan goal in a year, and g1 surprise faze early
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=CrackySoftSquidDxAbomb-ATUDvcH2lXsXJsmQ&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

it took faze four minutes to get a shot, and game one goes to the eu five seed over the na number one

it's early, and i think faze will be fine, but it doesn't look good so far...
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=FrozenSparklyEndiveBuddhaBar-UYWwsFiHVPmlRCSg&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

dorito a legend for this lock up

5-1 to g1 in game two! faze aren't speaking, they aren't moving, they aren't breathing. g1 won't leave them alone

faze give away possession in their own corner and it's clinical from g1

DORITOOOOOOO

do faze have life?

faze slow the game to a crawl and steal it in OT, do g1 have the resolve to pull it out anyway?

on champions field i was just thinking about how i saw dorito get uber-tilted in a 2s stream and rage quit and wondering about the g1 mental, and then they start game five aflame

what if every play is an all-in play

firstkiller turtle?

faze look to pull within one in the final seconds, but mist hits it perpendicular to the goal and g1 take the upset. not sure i've ever seen anyone backcheck & late chalenge as effectively as dorito, that dude was _everywhere_. if this was a longer series it seems like faze might have had a chance, but g1 just blitzed faze in three games

# Group A: G2 - KRU

g2 are on an every-other-lan kick, and given their ninth place finish in fall they're _destined_ for top-2 here. kru looked good in a warmup tournament, but that was against some fellow minnows. g2 solid favorites here, but never say never to some cocky sam lan boys

turns out drufinho is also kbm, so sam has the kbm boys with torsos missing this major

kru take a 2-1 lead in game one, looking faster than g2, but g2 steal game one in OT with some lucky timing and a missed save from brad

game two is much more straightforward - kru are the ones forced to take risks, and g2 punish twice. kru battle back but can't level it, and g2 are on the precipice of a sweep

# Group D: Pioneers - Gen.G

pioneers might be awful, psyonix sure thinks they are since they're playing both matches on the b-stream today. the only worry for gen.g is that chronic is in a fennec, which seems odd for him

gen.g are much faster, much cleaner, and get on the board 87 seconds in. might be an early ff

game one never got out of hand, finishing 2-1, but kcp will feel like their mechanics let them down and might have a shot if they can get on track in that area

scrub with a pool shot pass via appjack's car, and game two is _also_ tied 1-1 early

okay this is pretty nice
https://www.youtube.com/live/ukAN3COAqDs?feature=share&t=14284

still only sweeps on the b-stream, but for what it's worth this was at least briefly in doubt

# Group D: Complexity - Oxygen

this might be the match i'm most excited for. both of these teams can be the best in the world, but neither seem to be able to do it consistently. with rise back from his injury i think oxygen are slightly favored, but i'm full VAMOS on this one

what a pass from reysbull to open the scoring
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=PricklyAntsyMoonTooSpicy-2_Ujlw4ZShvDD7Bf&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

complexity are forced to make 10 saves to hold off oxygen, we'll see if they can win more of the share of the pressure moving forward or if oxygen will be able to capitalize instead

well rise seems fine

that's a sick transition from crr

the bull is on the board!

oxygen starve out complexity, and it feels like rise is always there

this is tense

oxygen no, not like this
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=SingleFastPeachJonCarnage-2WLEAbI2d09oJF1c&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

oxg score two in the final minute, but can't tie it up on zero seconds and complexity take it. vamoooooooos

# Group B: Karmine Corp - Dignitas

b-stream clean win for kc incoming, let the sweep streak continue

dig manage to score first and hold a lead til halftime, but no longer

you can watch dig die if you'd like
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukAN3COAqDs?start=16716" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

dig do force OT in game two, including taking a lead over kc, but OT lasts but a few seconds before a standard double tap takes kc to match point. game three is a standard karmine corp win. on one hand, this was a 1 v 5 matchup and dignitas are the weakest five seed i can remember from a major region, on the other, g1 smacked faze around in the inverse matchup

# Group B: Falcons - Vitality

can falcons get their mojo back? the desk and chat both pick them as favorites, but everyone admits it might be wishful thinking

falcons score first and look good doing it, but vitality rip off three straight goals to take the opener, wonder if that momentum will carry through

that's a sick finish from saizen
<iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AdorableManlyLarkPraiseIt-qvEGqh8vbLBpFEe2&parent=mod-gg.github.io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>

my takeaway overall is that falcons can't manage boost and are perma-starved. alpha feels the same way and gives them the boot

wild pass for the equalizer

trk up _so fast_

we get to see a champions field match between vitality and falcons, this is good

get it get it

vitality equalize, and khalid rips them a new one

saizen parks it and vitality equalize for a third time, just to give it right back on kickoff

falcons survive!
