eg are bad maybe? this series had several bad goals/confusing rotations/missed saves, idk, maybe they're just not warm yet

vitality beat moist in 4!

liquid stave off aogiri with a kickoff butt pinch (bds win that long overtime on the split)

# R2 Team Liquid - Quadrant

quadrant was one of the few teams that actually showed up and dominated round one, and liquid were in it with aogiri to the end, so you'd think quadrant would win on form but idk we'll see

nothing happened? i don't really understand, but liquid look so _flat_ compared to last spring. quadrant walk away with an easy win

vitality beat oxygen and move to the 2-0 group

aztral misses a _wide_ open net, turboclappers (dying/hibbs/lasa) don't, and moist ~is in the 0-2~ lives on a 0:00 dribble

moist win, escape. kc do not, g1 beat them to go to 2-0
