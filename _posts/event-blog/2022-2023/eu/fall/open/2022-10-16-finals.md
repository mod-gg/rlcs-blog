# Oxygen - Quadrant
oxygen enter this semi as heavy favorites, quadrant weren't great in quals and swiss, it's already a shock that they're here. oxygen are still very unclear as to how good they can be and how consistent, but they've done nothing but win so far

looks as expected, but what an incredible goal by kash

i love how you can watch this from the end-line POV knowing there's a chance something weird is coming, and then it does

archie capitalizes on a _tight_ passing window, and oxygen take the swing game and become huge favorites in the series

oxygen win game six comfortably, and this feels like early dignitas from last year, hopefully they can sustain it better this time around
