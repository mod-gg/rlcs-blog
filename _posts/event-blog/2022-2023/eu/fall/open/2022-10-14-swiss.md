# roster notes
solary is now the old guard of fairy/kaydop/chausette. vitality grabbed saizen to add to radosin and alpha, but <b>didn't make the main event</b>
joreuz/oaly/archie create "team inconsistency" under the oxygen flag
vatira was the one who really set everything off, swapping places with aztral between kc and moist, and then kc add exotiik to replace noly
soniqs become a eu org this year, picking up metsa/mikeboy/tho?
g1 grab the spaniards atomik/marc_by_8/dorito
williams resolve make a new team, i can't even figure out who they have, but they'll probably be fun at some point
some other teams seem to be showing up, tundra, quandrant, a new guild, deevo on endpoint, idk what is happening out here
# r1 karmine-solary
solary are getting absolutely stomped by this new kc roster. kc's faster/cleaner/better in basically every aspect so far, tons of space for them to operate

and then games two and three happen and solary turtles up. they double commit through half the game, but only give up one goal over two games and take the lead over kc
kc score at 0 seconds in game five to force OT, and solary's absolutely chaotic defense gives way in g5 OT

okay europe is wild every match but one went to game five, multiple game five overtimes, no team is good no team is bad
just looking at the r2 matchups i'm not sure i could pick out which side would be 1-0 vs 0-1
# bds-g1
the marc_by_8 revenge game is so close, but bds hold on in the end

# karmine-bds
bds are better than kc. kc might take a bit to be able to play at this level with consistency
the other winners finals are aogiri-moist, which implies some confusing results i may have missed
okay maybe kc has something going here

bds pulls it off in the end, just making it a lot more complicated than necessary. they and moist will be top seeds for the weekend
# solary-quadrant
solary's gonna be on stream a lot. quadrant is kash/eekso, which is one of those "should be better than their results" teams
