# Evil Geniuses - Team Liquid

liquid just seem like a more deserving finalist and more deserving major participant

# Karmine Corp - G1

none of bds, moist, oxygen made it this far, kc is the last bastion of potential consistency

g1 needs to win this for the major, but they're not gonna if they keep getting dribbled

that's a ton of power

the difference in camera angles between play and replay shows the level of confusion this double generated

g1's loss kicks them from the major, so moist and liquid will go. bds finish _eighth_ in the region, only one point ahead of vitality and tundra and behind eg & g1 in addition to the five major participants (kc oxygen quadrant moist liquid). karmine hit 40 points in a region where no one else will approach 30 by making all three grand finals. a liquid victory in the finals is the difference between 2nd and 5th for them in the major

# Karmine Corp - Team Liquid

a grand finals for the clips and lulz, hopefully

brilliant aerial pass
