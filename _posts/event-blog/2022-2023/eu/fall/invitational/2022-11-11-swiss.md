moist lose again...this time to heet

# R3: Tundra - Aogiri

tundra entered today tied for fifth, but this is an 0-2 matchup and they'll be disappointed they're not fighting harder for the major spots given what's happening to moist

ridiculous passing play

# R4: BDS - Tundra

another elimination game for the major

rezears has the juice

monkey moon plays the entire series in the fennec, which i don't think i've ever seen, and bds escape in game five on the back of seikoo

quadrant go out with only one series win, so they don't clinch major (still very favored)

# R5: BDS - Team Liquid

bds is holding on to a major slot by the skin of their teeth, and liquid are _right_ behind them, so this is basically an elimination match for the major but not a clincher

this is a ranked match! neither side is communicating - there's double commits, cross-field ballchase challenges, aggressive positions in the box, and well-meaning but confusing showoff touches everywhere. atow reins the mechanics in, and then bds crumble on kickoff twice in a row and they're looking down the barrel now

that is a tight follow

liquid are scoring for fun - looks like liquid in, bds out (because of quarterfinal matchups)

quadrant now clinches, so only two spots left up for grabs (though the moist spot is pretty solid regardless)

resolve beat moist! i still expect moist to be fine, but they're at least technically in trouble now

fairy peeeeeeeeak
