quadrant are winning by hitting the ball harder. you'd think bds would be able to counter that, but seikoo especially looks flummoxed

is this a touch?

williams resolve (breezi/flame/noahsaki) threatens a reverse sweep against vitality, and convert in the end! huge result for wr, pretty surprising

# Group: Moist - BDS

we're apparently fixated on this group today, which makes sense given that it's bds/quadrant/moist/tundra aka all teams on the border of major contention

bds with a sloppy but easy sweep, nothing crazy, just mediocre play. tundra beat quadrant, so that group is weird. german amigos reverse sweep deevo's endpoint squad. 

g1 can't get themselves out of trouble, but they sure make a wild attempt to do so

# Group: Liquid - Vitality

for the top of the group. vitality's run last regional was keyed by them winning the group and getting the bye, can they pull another upset and do it again?

can't really do any better than that

radosin 2, liquid 1, in style

liquid win the series and top the group. vitality will have to play again today, liquid skip to the quarters

reverse sweep time: g1 over karmine, soniqs over endpoint, but quadrant get the bye by holding off moist's reverse sweep

# Bracket Round 1: G1 - Vitality

game one is very sloppy, with every goal coming off giveaways and bad positioning

bye g1

bds, suh, and soniqs also go out before the weekend, none of those teams are likely to be able to make the major from this position
