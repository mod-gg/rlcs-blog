# Liquid - Quadrant

liquid seem again like they've established themselves a tier above quadrant: fighting for titles instead of fighting for finals. quadrant are just so limited offensively, it takes a number of miracles for them to keep up with the true elite teams. can they pull it off this time?

liquid can just do so much

atow puts quadrant effectively to bed. the scorelines are close, but the difference is clear

that's a very fair timeout for oxygen, they can't keep up with how karmine corp are putting the ball into space, something's gotta change

ITACHIIIIIII

lol okay karmine scored three in the first minute after the oxygen timeout. don't see that very often, kc are on a different level right now

even when oxygen take a lead karmine feel like a formality. they score again immediately after this to take the lead, and then again to double it

# Karmine Corp - Liquid

liquid haven't lost a game in the bracket, are 17-3 this weekend, and have won two of three against karmine corp. kc are still the class of europe, with five straight regional finals and a 50% win rate in grand finals. i'd have to guess karmine in five because i believe in overall form over weekend form, but TL have a chance to push it for sure

karmine come out much more ready for the fire

liquid look like they're going to even the series, scoring three in the first minute of game two, but kc make a nice passing play to close it up

the first shot deserved the goal, the second earned it

a series of blowout starts continues

game four goes to 8-1 KC

karmine grind out a win in six. there were doubts! but the doubts didn't last long. not really sure what any other team can do to keep up overall, but kcorp are still vulnerable in single series. this is setting everything up for karmine corp - gen.g someday, i wonder if we'll see either of them make it to that point
