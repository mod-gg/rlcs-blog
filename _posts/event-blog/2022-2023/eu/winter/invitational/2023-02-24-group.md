- split points are very close. liquid/vitality/oxygen all on 27 for 2/3/4 and very likely to follow kc in to the major, then german amigos at 23, quadrant 20, moist 19, g1/soniqs/williams 16, bds 13, presumably all for one slot
- soniqs are playing with sub andythemandy (coach) today, arju connection issues


# Group: G1 - BDS

g1 are above bds in points, but everyone still believes in the bds monster. it's a marc_by_8 revenge game to boot

what if you just do it all yourself atomik

bds were in so much control, and then suddenly they weren't

g1 take it in four, with an overtime poach as monkey moon punts it about twenty feet directly down the middle and gets correctly punished for it

solary beat karmine!

# Group: Liquid - Williams Resolve

liquid? flame?

breezi is the most reckless third man imaginable. they've been burnt for five open net goals, but this time it works out

liquid pull the reverse sweep and will likely win their group because vitality lost to someone called like fuhfaxdop? zero clue who they are or how they made the invitational

# Group: Oxygen - Quadrant

kash is in a fennec instead of a dominus. oxygen in three

g1 beat moist to take their group. liquid reverse sweeps vitality to top their group, vitality sink to third below fufaxdop

bds knocks out tundra. soniqs, solary, williams resolve also go out 

# Bracket: Moist - Quadrant

someone will get knocked out of the major here (as will happen in most matches in this round). i...genuinely don't know what to expect from this one. if kash is in the dominus i lean quadrant, but moist have won a lot of matches at this level

ah dang kash still in the fennec, can't imagine they pull this one now

vatira has absolutely wrecked color palettes across the world. he played well in a slime green/matte purple fennec, and now every match has at least one gross barney in it (juicy here)

what an awkward angle that joyo converts

moist just absolutely melted for about ninety seconds, and quadrant turn that into the reverse sweep. moist out of the major, quadrant still in with a shot. they even overcame fennec-kash via some great eekso games.

vitality knock out das amigos, fufaxdop make top 8 over suh, bds sweep monaco. german amigos will have to wait and watch as vitality, bds, and quadrant all push for the major spot currently in the germans possession
