# Liquid - Quadrant

liquid are better than quadrant, liquid recently swept quadrant, but quadrant have everything to fight for. whole desk goes liquid, which i think is right but is often a curse

okay maybe kash has earned the fennec today

# G1 - Vitality

g1 are still a couple wins from catching up to german amigos, but they need to start somewhere

this series is alternating between a grind and a slop fest. g1 go up 2-1 in game score with some assistance, as they win game 3 1-0 with saizen saving a shot from radosin on an open net

radosin is cycling through some uniquely ugly car choices, but they work for him

# Oxygen - Fufahxdop

"fax" got here from points they earned in fall, that's the invitiational style, which is interesting. hard to imagine a heavier underdog here - a top 3 side against a team that hasn't made a regional yet this split

oxygen were better for four games. not a lot better, but better nonetheless. bye fax, wonder if we'll see you again

# Karmine Corp - BDS

the hammer slot today for the classic matchup. bds need to win this and again to even force a tiebreaker for the major (they need to outperform g1, who already won today). karmine are still the top of the region, bds haven't been for seven months now. monkey moon is top of the world in twos, but extra and seikoo haven't been able to keep up. bds are also playing from home instead of at bootcamp, which i haven't seen for a while

ridiculous aggressive positioning leads to an impeccable pass

perfect placement

itachi is hitting new heights right now

exotiik scored 909 in a normal, five minute game, with a 3-1 scoreline. he just did absolutely everything you can do in a single game. bds timeout

bds do manage a game, but they're already 3-0 down when it happens, so they go out of the tournament and miss their second straight major. bds just aren't as good anymore - they're not quicker than everyone, not cleaner than everyone, not steadier than everyone. everyone else has not just caught up, but passed them by
