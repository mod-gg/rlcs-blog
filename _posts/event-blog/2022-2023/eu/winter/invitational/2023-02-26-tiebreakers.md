bonus content! german amigos, quadrant, and g1 are all tied for the last slot for the european major, so that tie needs to be broken. quadrant get the advantage because they have the season point advantage, so they'll face the winner of german amigos and g1. since this is happening right after the finals, g1 are coming off a loss a couple hours ago, while quadrant and german amigos were out earlier in the tournament

# German Amigos - G1

g1 are the only team of the three to have made a semifinal, and they lost to liquid as liquid went on to be champs. german amigos have been a pinnacle of consistency without any true high water marks, playing challenges and defensive styles and grinding teams down into dust

marc has spent so much time causing chaos, and now he nails the drop pass for what might be the dagger

g1 do hold on to that win, and poor german amigos. dropped from evil geniuses, no sponsor incoming, were in the fifth slot coming into this regional and just couldn't hold on. g1 move on to play quadrant for the major

# Quadrant - G1

not sure there's a favorite in this one, and not sure either team would be favored to do too much at the major, but it should at least be some fun rockets. relatingwave has made every open-era lan (five in a row since the start of rlcsx), can he keep the streak?

kash with a wild reverse angle goal, from a place that doesn't normally see a lot of shots

quadrant save their own shot off the beautiful pass play, and atomik punishes with a shockingly fast dribble off the side wall

g1 take a timeout and get immediately faked out by kash and wave

g1 score a flurry, but wave hits a brilliant skim pass to get one closer

dorito(!) and relatingwave(!!!) have a back and forth matchup, each creating nearly every chance for their respective teams, and then dorito takes a lovely pass in overtime and slots it to move to match point

g1 do it! they pull off the three goal comeback on neo tokyo and send wave/kash/eekso packing. eekso in particular was invisible for most of that series, not really sure what happened to him there. atomik & dorito will play in their first rlcs lan, marc_by_8 his first since bds crashed and burned last winter. they'll get a shot to close the gap a bit for an auto-bid to worlds, even if they won't be favored for a top 8 they'll still be in with a shot. poor quadrant suffer an absolute meltdown and i'd bet really come to regret this one - they're also in the thick of the worlds race and i don't expect they'll start spring split favored for another major run
