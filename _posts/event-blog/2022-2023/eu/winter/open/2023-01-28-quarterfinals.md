german amigos are able to take the series in 5, they won all four games in which they scored first. impeccable defending, timely goalscoring, and some luck propel the germans through

# Karmine Corp - G1

that's a sick pass

it looked like g1 had the upper hand for the first couple games, but they could only get a split out of that and now kc are dominant again

g1 timeout doesn't do anything

# Soniqs - Oxygen

rise's time to shine, oxygen should really win this one, and probably comfortably

soniqs rout oxygen in game one, smokez scores 4 as joreuz is continually isolated at the back, then game two starts off with a spicy one

oxygen are humming now, soniqs feel on the ropes if oxygen can hit pass plays like this

rise with time and space. i like watching this whole thing in arju's cam because you can see early how hopeless the situation is

rise on a no-goals challenge today

# Moist - Vitality

even without rise i think moist would be favored on fall results and player talent, but vitality beat karmine corp to get top spot so they're definitely more in form. here's the thing about vitality though: this is the last split that they'll ride with this team. zen turns 15 in a few weeks, and is rated as `better than daniel/firstkiller, like, by a lot` and vitality has already said they anticipate running the spring roster as a true 4 man rotation instead of 3 and a sub. obviously that raises a metric ton of questions about mentality for radosin and saizen this split, and many a joke has been cracked about how `saizen` is just a placeholder for zen. kinda wild that they're rounding into form right now, not like that's going to preclude them from adding zen but it somehow makes it an even weirder situation

that's an unreal read by aztral

vitality start collapsing, and radosin is there to pick them up
