This is a blog focused on the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS). It has two main components: Event Blogs and Analyses. 

Events blogs are stream-of-consciousness posts about RLCS events, primarily regionals, majors, and world championships. 

Analyses are posts about RLCS using data manicured by [octane.gg](https://octane.gg). The goal of these is to use data science to find insights and patterns in RLCS matches. Supporting code can be found at my github repostitory [mod-gg/rl](https://github.com/mod-gg/rl)
